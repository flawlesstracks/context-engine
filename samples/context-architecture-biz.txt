Context Architecture is a consulting business founded by CJ Mitchell in Atlanta Georgia in 2025. The company helps individuals and small to medium businesses structure their messy knowledge so AI tools can actually use it effectively. The core problem they solve is what CJ calls the Midas Problem which is that AI gives you exactly what you asked for but not what you meant because it lacks context about who you are and what you actually need.

The company offers three service tiers. The Foundation tier includes discovery sessions ontology design knowledge graph creation and MCP integration for SMBs wanting smarter AI chat tools. The Voice Layer tier adds custom voice persona creation and real time voice interfaces for client facing businesses that need phone or voice AI. The Digital Twin tier is the premium offering that adds personality capture and expertise preservation for firms that want to preserve partner or founder knowledge.

Target clients include law firms losing institutional knowledge when senior partners retire, financial advisory practices that need voice AI knowing each clients portfolio and preferences, healthcare practices wanting AI that understands patient history, and real estate brokerages needing property knowledge systems. The competitive advantage is methodology not technology since the underlying AI models are commoditized but the process of structuring domain specific knowledge into queryable systems is the defensible moat.

The founding thesis is that the voice layer is becoming commoditized and everyone will have access to human sounding AI voices but the knowledge layer is the moat. Context Architecture builds that knowledge layer. Revenue model is project based consulting with recurring maintenance contracts. The company is pre-revenue and in MVP stage with the first product being an open source CLI tool called context-engine that automates the text to structured JSON pipeline.
