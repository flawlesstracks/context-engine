# I Built an AI Tool That Actually Remembers You

## HOOK (0:00-0:30)
What if I told you that every time you talk to ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini... it forgets everything the moment you close the tab? Your name, your job, your preferences - gone. I built a tool that fixes that. And I built it in one night.

## THE PROBLEM (0:30-2:00)
- The Midas Problem: AI gives you what you asked for, not what you meant
- Every conversation starts from zero
- Show example: asking Claude something generic vs asking with context
- "What if AI could actually KNOW you?"

## THE BUILD (2:00-5:00)
- Screen recording: messy text going in, structured JSON coming out
- Show the demo.js running both person and business
- Explain what each field means in plain English
- "I fed it a paragraph about myself and it extracted my relationships, my projects, my values - all structured"

## THE VISION (5:00-7:00)
- This is one tool in a bigger system called Context Architecture
- Foundation → Voice Layer → Digital Twin
- "The voice layer is becoming commoditized. The knowledge layer is the moat."
- Connect to the bigger trend: Google just launched personal intelligence, everyone is racing to solve context

## THE CALL TO ACTION (7:00-8:00)
- The tool is open source (link in description)
- "If you want AI that actually knows your business, that's what I'm building"
- Subscribe for the series: building Context Architecture in public

## B-ROLL NEEDED
- Terminal running demo.js
- Side by side: messy text vs clean JSON
- The output JSON scrolling
- Context Architecture service tier diagram

## THUMBNAIL IDEAS
- Split screen: messy text (red/chaotic) vs clean JSON (green/organized)
- "AI FORGOT YOU" in bold text
- CJ pointing at terminal with surprised expression
